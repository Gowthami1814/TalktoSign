# TalktoSign

* Communication would be one of the most important aspects of our daily lives, but still, a big part of the hearing-impaired community faces a relevant barrier when it comes to interacting with someone who does not have knowledge of sign language. To tackle this problem, this Project proposes a speech to sign language translation system that targets the Indian Sign Language (ISL). The system listens to voice input, converts the spoken content into text with speech recognition and then into ISL signs using a 3D animated avatar. The ultimate goal is to write an interactive communication bridge between hearing and non-hearing humans, by means of cheap, widely available, and opensource tools.

* A Web Application which takes in live audio speech recording as input, converts it into text and displays the relevant Indian Sign Language animations.
Front-end using HTML,CSS,JavaScript.
Speech recognition using JavaScript Web speech API.
Text Preprocessing using Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK).
A 3D animation of a character created using Blender 3D tool.
